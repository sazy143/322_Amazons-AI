Because we will be working on a single program it will be critical that we do not create merge conflicts that will require us to manually parse through code.
If you would like to work on code for a while create your own branch and start developing there, which we can merge back to the main branch at a later time.
If you want to fix something minor(hot fix), and/or work on the main branch ensure no one else is working on the main branch or a merge conflict will arise, and we will have to manually parse the code (not fun).
